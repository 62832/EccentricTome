# Eccentric Tome

This mod adds a single item: the Eccentric Tome.

The Tome solves a single problem: managing all of your guide books.

The Tome allows many (infinite?) books to be combined into a single item, and enables them to be retrieved when needed.

## Crafting

Craft the Tome in the crafting grid with a book and a bookcase

Craft the Tome with other books in the crafting grid to combine them

## Controls

`Shift` + `Right-Click` while holding Tome to convert to the book for the block you're looking at

`Left-Click` on air to revert a book back into the Tome

`Shift` + `Q` while holding the converted tome to eject a book from it

## Download

You can download the v1.0.0 jar under the releases section on the right. Curseforge is still reviewing the project, so you'll have to manually install it for now.
